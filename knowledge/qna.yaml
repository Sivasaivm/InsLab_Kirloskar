task_description: Teach the Large Language Model about the KIRLOSKAR PUMP type DB
created_by: IBM Ecosystems Engineering SI Lab
domain: pumps
seed_examples:
- answer: |
    Delivery liquid too viscous.
  question: what showuld we do when Motor will not start?
- answer: |
    Rotor parts touching the casing.
  question: How do you resolve when Pump rotor locked in standstill position?
- answer: |
    Insufficient lubrication
    Bearing failure or excessive bearing wear
    Blockages or restrictions in the pump or lines causing excessive friction
    Operation of the pump outside its designed parameters
  question:  Why might a pump heat up and seize?
- answer: |
    A malfunctioning or incorrectly set flow control valve
    Excessive pump speed
    Incorrect pump selection for the application
  question: What might cause a pump to deliver an excessive amount of fluid?
- answer: |
    Wear and tear on the impeller or other internal components
    The buildup of sediment or debris in the pump or lines
    Inadequate lubrication of bearings or other moving parts
    Increased viscosity or density of the pumped fluid
    Cavitation occurring within the pump
  question: What factors could lead to the deterioration of a pump's delivery performance?
