- context: |
    Issue: After stopping pump runs in reverse direction, 
    Reference: 52
    Issue: Motor will not start, 
    Reference: 14 22 60
    Actual Steps Descriptions
    Reference 14: Delivery liquid too viscous.
    Reference 22 : Separation of crystals from the flow of pumping liquid falling below the temperature limit/equilibrium temp.
    Reference 52 : Non-return valve gets caught.
    Reference 60 : Short circuit in the motor.
- answer: |
    Steps to be followed to fix this issue.
    Reference 14 : Delivery liquid too viscous.

    Issue: Pump rotor locked in standstill position, 
    Reference : 22 45 46 50
    Actual Steps Descriptions
    Reference 45 : Pump casing under stress.  
    Reference 46 : Pipeline under stress.
    Reference 22 : Separation of crystals from the flow of pumping liquid falling below the temperature limit/equilibrium temp.
    Reference 50 : Rotor parts touching the casing.
