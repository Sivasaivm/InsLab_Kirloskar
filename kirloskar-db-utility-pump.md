PUMP TROUBLE

When investigating trouble with Kirloskar pumps, always remember that pumps have been

tested at the factory and are mechanically correct when sent out. Discounting the

possibility of damage during transit, most of the trouble in the field is due to faulty

installation. Investigation shows that the majority of troubles with centrifugal pumps result

from faulty conditions on the suction side.

BREAK DOWN-CAUSE-CHECK POINTS

In case of break down we recommend the location of the fault by referring the table for

‘Break Down Check Points’ given at the end of this manual.

6\.9.2 Disassembly of pumps fitted with a Mechanical Seal:

Remove the impeller key and carefully withdraw the shaft sleeve complete with the rotating

element of the mechanical seal.

Note: If after examination of the rotating element, it is found necessary to remove the rubber

bellows from the shaft sleeve, the complete mechanical seal assembly will have to be replaced.

Removal of the mechanical seal depends on the pump construction:

For pumps with shaft sizes 25, 35 and 45 with a bolted casing cover construction only.

a) Remove stud nuts from the bearing housing first, before proceeding with instruction b).

For pumps with shaft size 25 or 35 and with clamped casing cover construction, commence with

instruction b).

b) Using screw drivers or similar tools as levers in the recesses provided carefully rise apart and

remove the casing cover complete with the stationary element of the mechanical seal, from the

bearing housing. Care must be taken to ensure that the stationary element of the seal and the

shaft are not damaged when extracting the shaft.

c) The stationary element of the seal may be removed from the casing cover by pressing out by

hand from the drive end. If the stationary element is damaged or shows signs of wear, it must be

replaced. Pull off thrower from shaft. Unscrew the hexagon screws and remove both bearing

covers from the bearing housing. Using a soft faced hammer or suitable drift, carefully drive the

pump shaft out with its bearings in the direction of the drive end, i.e. away from the pump end,

ensuring that the impeller nut thread is not damaged. Care must be taken to ensure that the pump

end bearing passes centrally through the bore of the drive end bearing housing.

6\.9.3 Installation of Mechanical Seals

Lubricate the outer surface of the stationary element of the mechanical seal (230) with soapy

water or silicone grease (not oil), ensure that it is square to its housing in the casing cover (220)

and push home by hand, taking care not to apply excessive force or to damage the sealing

surface. Check that it has been seated fully and that the sealing surface is clean and undamaged.

Refit the casing cover to the bearing housing; fit the bolts for the bolted casing cover, tightening

them uniformly and in diagonally opposed pairs sequence.

Position the rotating seal face over the shaft to butt against the static seal element, taking care

not to damage the sealing surfaces. Insert the gasket into the sleeve and ensure that it is properly

seated.

Lubricate the inner and outer surfaces of the sleeve lightly with silicone grease, fit the spring

assembly in position and mount the sleeve over the shaft, compress the spring and insert the

impeller key to retain the sleeve in position. Ensure that the rotating seal face is floating against

the spring before re-fitting the impeller.

GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS

FOR INSTALLATION, OPERATION

& MAINTENANCE OF KIRLOSKAR CENTRIFUGAL PUMPS

WARNING

The equipment supplied is designed for specific capacity, speed, pressure and temperature. Do not

use the equipment beyond the capacities for which it is manufactured. The equipment

manufactured is also shop tested for satisfactory performance and if it is operated in excess of the

conditions for which it is manufactured, the equipment is subjected to excessive stresses and

strains.

LOCATION

The pump should be located as near the liquid source as possible. This will minimize suction lift

and pump will give better performance.

Ample space should be provided on all the sides so that the pump can be inspected while in

operation and can be serviced whenever required.

FOUNDATION

The foundation should be sufficiently substantial to sustain any vibrations and to form a

permanent rigid support for the base plate. This is important in maintaining the alignment of a

directly connected unit. A concrete foundation on a solid base is advisable. Foundation bolts of the

proper size should be embedded in the concrete located by a drawing or template. A pipe sleeve of

two and one half diameter larger than the bolt should be used to allow movement for the final

position of the foundation bolts. Earthing is required to be provided to the base plate.

ALIGNMENT

Pumps and the drivers supplied by the manufacturers, mounted on a common base plate are

accurately aligned before dispatch. However, as the alignments are likely to be disturbed during

transit to some extent and hence must not be relied upon to maintain the factory alignment. Re-

alignment is necessary after the complete unit has been leveled on the foundation and again after

the grout has been set and foundation bolts have been tightened. The alignment must be checked

after the unit is piped up and re-checked periodically.

FLEXIBLE COUPLING

A flexible coupling will not compensate for the misalignment of the pump and driver shafts. The

purpose of the flexible coupling is to compensate for temperature changes and to permit the

movement of the shafts without interference with each other while transmitting power from the

driver to the pump. There are two types of misalignments.

\1) Angular misalignment – Shaft with axis concentric, but not parallel\.

\2) Parallel misalignment – Shaft with axis parallel, but not concentric\.

<a name="br30"></a> 

LEVELING THE UNIT

When the unit is received with the pump and driver mounted on the base plate, it should be placed

on the foundation and the coupling halves disconnected. The coupling should not be reconnected

until all misalignment operations have been completed. The base plate must be supported evenly

on wedges inserted under the four corners so that it will not be distorted or sprung by the uneven

distribution of the weight. Adjust the wedges until the shafts of the pump and the driver are in

level. Check the coupling faces, suction and discharge flanges for the horizontal and vertical

position by means of spirit level.

FLEXIBLE COUPLING ALIGNMENT

The two halves of the coupling should be at least 3 mm apart so that they cannot touch each

other when the driver shaft is rotated. Necessary tools for approximately checking are straight

edge or an outside caliper. A check for parallel misalignment is made by placing a straight edge

across both coupling periphery at the top, bottom and both the sides. The unit will be in parallel

alignment when the straight edge rests evenly on the coupling periphery at all the positions. Care

must be taken that the straight edge must be parallel to the axis of the shaft. May be other

alternative method like laser can be used.

GROUTING

When the alignment is correct, the foundation bolts should be tightened evenly but not too firmly.

The unit can then be grouted by working soft concrete under the edges. Foundation bolts should

not be fully tightened until the grout is hardened, usually 48 hours after pouring.

FACTORS THAT MAY DISTURB ALIGNMENT

The unit should be periodically checked for alignment. If the unit does not stay in line after being

properly installed, the following are possible causes:

1\. Setting, seasoning of the foundation.

2\. Pipe strains distorting or shifting the machines.

3\. Wear of the bearing.

PIPING

Both suction and delivery pipes and accessories should be independently supported near the

pump, so that when the flanges, bolts are tightened no strains will be transmitted to the pump

casing. It is usually advisable to increase the size of both the suction and delivery pipe at the

pump nozzles in order to decrease the loss of head due to friction and for the same reason piping

should be arranged with minimum possible bends as possible, or it should be made with long

radius wherever possible. The pipe lines should be free from scales, welding residuals, etc., and

have to be mounted in such a way that they can be connected to suction and delivery flanges

without any stress on the pump. It can be achieved by supporting the pipelines at appropriate

locations.

SUCTION PIPE

The suction pipe should be as short as possible. This can be achieved by placing the pump near

the liquid to be pumped. The suction pipe must be kept free from air leakages. This is particularly

important when the suction lift is high. A horizontal suction line must have a gradual rise to the

pump. Any high point in the pipe will be filled with air and thus prevent proper operation of the

pocket in the top of the reducer and the pipe. Use an eccentric piece instead.

The end of the suction pipe must be well submerged to avoid whirlpools and ingress of air but

must be kept clear of any deposits of mud, silt, grit, etc. The pipe must be away from any side of

<a name="br31"></a> 

the wall by 450 mm. the end of the strainer must be provided with a strainer of sufficient open

area.

DELIVERY PIPE

A check (non-return) valve and a gate or sluice valve (regulating valve) should be installed in the

discharge line. The check valve placed between the pump and the gate valve is to protect the

pump from excessive pressure and to prevent water running back through the pump in case of

failure of the driving machine.

Discharge piping should be provided with a sluice valve adjacent to the delivery flange to control

the discharge if required.

VACUUM EQUALIZING LINE (AND LIQUID LINE)

If the pump draws from a system under vacuum an equalizing pipe must be carried from the

highest point of the suction line, however as close to the suction flange of the pump as possible,

to the top of the feed tank to keep gas bubbles that might have been entrapped in the flow from

entering the pump. The line should be fitted with an isolating valve which should be closed only

for maintenance work on the pumpset.

Apply sealing liquid (external sealing) to the shaft seal cage to prevent entry of air in the case of

the pumps with packed stuffing box. It is convenient to tap the sealing liquid from the delivery line

above the non-return valve.

FOOT-VALVE

It is advisable to install a foot-valve to facilitate priming. The foot-valve should have sufficient

clear passage for water. Care must be taken to prevent foreign matter from being drawn in to the

pump or choking the foot-valve and for this purpose an efficient strainer should be provided.

STUFFING BOXES AND PACKING (only for gland packed pump)

Stuffing boxes should be carefully cleaned and packing placed in them. Be sure that sufficient

packing is placed at the back of the water seal cage. If the water to be pumped is dirty or gritty,

sealing water should be piped to the stuffing boxes from clean outside source of supply in order to

prevent damage to the packing and shaft. In placing the packing, each packing ring should be cut

to the proper length so that ends come together but do not overlap. The succeeding rings of

packing should not be pressed too tight, as it may result in burning the packing and cutting the

shaft. If the stuffing box is not properly packed, friction in stuffing box prevents turning the rotor

by hand. On starting the pump, it is well to have the packing slightly loose without causing an air

leak, and if it seems to leak, instead of putting too much pressure on the gland, put some heavy

oil in the stuffing box until the pump works properly and then gradually tighten up the gland. The

packing should be occasionally changed.

BALL BEARINGS

Correct maintenance of ball bearings is essential. The bearing manufacturers give the following as

a guide to re-lubrication periods under normal condition.

Three monthly when on continuous duty.

Six monthly when on eight hour per day duty.

The bearings and housings should be completely cleaned and recharged with fresh grease after

2500 hrs. or the nearest pump overhaul time.

PRIMING

No pumping action occurs unless the pump casing is filled with the liquid. Pump casing and

suction pipe must therefore be completely filled with liquid and thus all air removed before the

pump is started. Several different priming methods can be used depending on the kind of

installation and service involved.

\1) Liquid level above pump level\.

Pump is set below liquid level of source of supply, so that liquid always flows to pump

under positive head.

\2) Priming with foot-valve\.

a. When pump is installed on suction lift with foot valve at the end of suction line, fill

pump with water from some outside source till all air is expelled and water flows

through the air vent.

b. When there is liquid under some pressure in the discharge pipe, priming can be effected

by bypassing the pressured liquid around the check and gate valve. Of course, the initial

priming must be effected from some outside source.

Note: In this case, the foot-valve must be capable of withstanding pump pressure and

possible surge.

\3) Priming by ejector\.

An ejector operated by steam, compressed air or water under pressure and connected to air

vent at the top of casing can be used to remove air from pump and prime the pump on

suction lift installations.

\4) Priming by dry vacuum pump\.

A hand or power pump sucks in all the air from the casing and the suction pipe, and thus

primes the system.

STARTING

The pump must not be started without being primed. Be sure that the driver rotates in the proper

direction as indicated by a direction arrow on the pump casing.

RUNNING

On account of its simple construction, the centrifugal pump requires practically no attention while

running. Lubrication at the bearings and manipulation of the glands are the only things that need

attention from the operator.

STOPPING

Before stopping the pump; close the gate valve. This will prevent water hammer on the check

valve.

STUFFING BOXES (only for gland packed pump)

Do not tighten the glands excessively. A slight dripping of water from the stuffing boxes when

pump is running keeps packing in good condition.

CASING RINGS

Casing rings are fitted in the casing to reduce the quantity of water leaking back from the high

pressure side to the suction side. These casing rings are fitted to maintain a small clearance and

depend on the water in the pump for lubrication. When the rings are worn out, the clearance

becomes greater and more water passes back into the suction side. The rings must be replaced

from time to time to restore the pump efficiency to its normal value.

SPARE PARTS

A set of ball bearings, a set of casing rings and a set of gland packing rings / mechanical seal must

always be kept at hand to ensure uninterrupted service from the pump. While ordering for spare

parts, always give type, size and serial number of the pump as stamped on the nameplate.

PUMP TROUBLE

When investigating trouble with Kirloskar pumps, always remember that pumps have been tested

at the factory and are mechanically correct when sent out. Discounting the possibility of damage

during transit, most of the trouble in the field is due to faulty installation. Investigation shows that

the majority of troubles with centrifugal pumps result from faulty conditions on the suction side.
